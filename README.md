# smolv-js

## Overview

smolv-js is a JavaScript port of [SMOL-V](https://github.com/aras-p/smol-v) which transforms [SPIR-V](https://www.khronos.org/registry/spir-v/) into a smaller form that is more compressible.

This project aims to make a Web version of SMOL-V that also has a tiny binary size. The smolv-js decoder is a single 2.6 kB (compressed) JavaScript file.
